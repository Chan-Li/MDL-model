# MDL-model
Code for paper [Emergence of hierarchical modes from deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09859)(arXiv: 2208.09859). Here, given the current revolution of AI techniques (e.g., Chat GPT), a new learning framework named mode decomposition learning (MDL) is introduced, calling for a rethinking of conventional weight-based deep learning  through the lens of cheap and interpretable mode-based learning. MDL explains the network performance with the leading modes, displaying a striking piecewise power-law behavior.
# Requirements
Python 3.8
# Some instructions:
- The training folder contains the models used in the main text and supplementary materials, including the 1L1P MDL, 1L2P MDL, SVD, and two-factor low rank decomposition, two training datasets are considered (note that you have to upload the datasets yourself).
- The analysis folder contains the mean-field analysis of MDL (online dynamics) and the Gaussian-mixture task of MDL (1L2P) which generates the Figure 1 in the main text.
