# MDL-model
Code for paper [Emergence of hierarchical modes from deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09859)(arXiv: 2208.09859). Here, given the current revolution of AI techniques (e.g., Chat GPT), a new learning framework named mode decomposition learning (MDL) is introduced, calling for a rethinking of conventional weight-based deep learning  through the lens of cheap and interpretable mode-based learning. MDL explains the network performance with the leading modes, displaying a striking piecewise power-law behavior.
